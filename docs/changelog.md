# Changelog

All notable changes to bun-image-turbo.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **ML Tensor Conversion** - First JavaScript package with native SIMD-accelerated image-to-tensor conversion
  - `toTensor()` / `toTensorSync()` - Convert images to tensor format for ML frameworks
  - **Built-in normalization presets:**
    - `Imagenet` - ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    - `Clip` - CLIP, OpenCLIP, BLIP models (mean=[0.481, 0.458, 0.408], std=[0.269, 0.261, 0.276])
    - `ZeroOne` - Values in [0, 1] range
    - `NegOneOne` - Values in [-1, 1] range
  - **Layout support:**
    - `Chw` - Channel-first for PyTorch, ONNX Runtime
    - `Hwc` - Channel-last for TensorFlow.js
  - **Data types:** `Float32` (default) and `Uint8`
  - **Optional batch dimension** for inference-ready tensors
  - Helper methods: `toFloat32Array()`, `toUint8Array()`

### Performance

Benchmarks on Apple M3 Pro (800x600 JPEG input):

| Operation | Time | Throughput |
|-----------|------|------------|
| 224x224 ImageNet | 12.5ms | 80 img/s |
| 224x224 Uint8 | 5.2ms | 192 img/s |
| 384x384 ImageNet | 33.0ms | 30 img/s |
| 1920x1080 → 224x224 | 25.8ms | 39 img/s |

**10-16x faster than JavaScript-based alternatives!**

### Why This Matters

- **No manual normalization** - Built-in presets for popular models
- **SIMD optimization** - Native Rust with parallel channel processing via Rayon
- **Shrink-on-load** - Large images downscaled during decode
- **Zero-copy** - Minimal memory allocations
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with proper types

### Test Results

- **87 tests pass** (10 new toTensor tests)
- All normalization presets verified
- Both layouts (CHW/HWC) and dtypes (Float32/Uint8) tested

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **Cropping API** - Zero-copy image cropping with multiple modes
  - `crop()` / `cropSync()` - Extract regions from images
  - **Three cropping modes:**
    - Explicit coordinates: `{ x: 100, y: 50, width: 400, height: 300 }`
    - Aspect ratio: `{ aspectRatio: "16:9" }` or `{ aspectRatio: "1:1" }`
    - Dimensions with gravity: `{ width: 500, height: 500, gravity: "Center" }`
  - **9 gravity options:** Center, North, South, East, West, NorthWest, NorthEast, SouthWest, SouthEast
  - Crop support in `transform()` pipeline - crop is applied first for maximum performance

### Performance

- **Zero-copy cropping** using `crop_imm()` - essentially free operation (just pointer arithmetic)
- **Optimized transform pipeline** - crop → resize order reduces pixels for subsequent operations
- **Improved brightness adjustment** - replaced manual loop with optimized `brighten()` builtin (5x faster)
- **ThumbHash shrink-on-load** - decode at 100x100 max before hash generation

### Code Quality

- Added `#[inline(always)]` to hot encode functions
- Cleaner transform pipeline with crop-first architecture

### Test Results

- **64 tests pass** (8 new crop tests, 2 new transform+crop tests)
- All async and sync functions verified

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- **ThumbHash Support** - Generate smoother, more visually pleasing image placeholders
  - `thumbhash()` / `thumbhashSync()` - Generate ThumbHash from any image
  - `thumbhashToRgba()` / `thumbhashToRgbaSync()` - Decode ThumbHash to RGBA pixels
  - `thumbhashToDataUrl()` - Convert ThumbHash to data URL for inline use
  - Returns ready-to-use `dataUrl` for immediate display in HTML/CSS

### ThumbHash vs BlurHash

| Feature | ThumbHash | BlurHash |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Alpha channel | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Aspect ratio preserved | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Color accuracy | Better | Good |
| Hash size | ~25 bytes | ~28 chars |

### Test Results

- **56 tests pass** (including 12 new ThumbHash tests)
- All async and sync functions verified

---

## [1.4.6] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Reorganized test structure
  - `test/local/` - Local development tests
  - `test/packages/` - Package manager verification (bun, npm, yarn, pnpm)

### Verified

- **All Package Managers Working**:
  - Bun: 39 tests pass ✅
  - npm: 32 tests pass ✅
  - yarn: 32 tests pass ✅
  - pnpm: 32 tests pass ✅

---

## [1.4.5] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed

- **ESM/CJS Native Binding Loading** - Fixed native module loading in Node.js ESM context
  - Use `createRequire(import.meta.url)` for ESM modules
  - Proper fallback to native `require` for CJS context
  - Fixes "Cannot find package" errors when using `import` in Node.js

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **WebP Shrink-on-Load Optimization** - Decode WebP images directly to target resolution
  - Uses libwebp's native `use_scaling` for 1.15-1.25x faster WebP resize operations
  - Memory usage scales with OUTPUT size, not INPUT size (up to 25x reduction)

### Performance

- **WebP Resize** now **1.15-1.25x faster** than sharp on average
- Zero-copy pipeline reduces memory copies from 3-5 to 1-2 per operation

### Fixed

- Issue #3: WebP resize slower than sharp - Now faster!
- Issue #3: macOS requires libheif for WebP - CI only installs libheif for ARM64
- Issue #3: Linux installation fails - Added optionalDependencies
